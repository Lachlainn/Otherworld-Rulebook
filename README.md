Ever played Perudo and thought "hey could you make a TTRPG with nothing but D6s?"

Well they've already made that, it's called Pathfinder.

But did you also think to that "this game of perudo is fun, but I sure wish I was competing against the mythical Cú Chulainn rather than my mum?"

Ooh boy, do I have the project for you!

To read the current rules, go to https://github.com/Lachlainn/Otherworld-Rulebook/blob/main/main.pdf

The aimed tone is something fun and improvisational, but I hope people are naturally drawn to creating cool narratives togther. Want to help me tweak this? Go to https://github.com/Lachlainn/Otherworld-Rulebook/discussions, or if you find me annoying, fork this and fix it yourself! But be aware of my choice of lisence, at the very least clean-room reconstruct this :)

I write all this I don't even know if the game is any fun yet!
