Ever played Perudo and thought "hey could you make a TTRPG with nothing but D6s?"

Well they've already made that, it's called Pathfinder.

But did you maybe also think: "this game of Perudo is fun, but I sure wish I was competing against my mum pretending to be the mythical hero Cú Chulainn rather than my mum"?

Hoo boy, do I have the project for you!

To read the current rules, go to click <a href="main.pdf" target="_blank">here!</a> Note that if you download it and then open it, all the internal links should work.

The aimed tone is something fun and improvisational, but I hope people are naturally drawn to creating cool narratives together. Want to help me tweak this? Go to https://github.com/Lachlainn/Otherworld-Rulebook/discussions, or if you find me annoying, fork this and fix it yourself! But be aware of my choice of licence, at the very least clean-room reconstruct this :)

I write all this I don't even know if the game is any fun yet!

That said, if you want to use my cards as a template for your cards, no attribution required :) it's the content I mostly care about
