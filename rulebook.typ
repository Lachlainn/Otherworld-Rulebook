= Well met, brave adventurers!
Unfortunately, most of you are already dead. Sorry about that. You are now in the Otherworld. It's not a quite christian heaven or whatever, it's celtic. Go read about it if you want.

First off, learn how to play #link("https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/f4/4f/09-perudo-rulebook.pdf")[Perudo] (including the Calza rule) and then we can talk.

All done?

Great.

Otherworld is a crowd-decision improv dungeon crawler where you never have to go into a dungeon, and never have to make a decision. But you should get over that and make some decisions, I think.

#columns(2)[

= Setup

+ All players select a character to play as, or make up their own. Feel free to name your charcater!
+ Players should all fill out prompt cards. Write anything that comes to mind, and these are passed to the storyteller. If nothing comes to mind, put an animal, a vegetable and a normal RPG location (like a pub, a ferry crossing, a cool tree etc)
+ Agree on a last stand condition. This could be: we run out of cards in the discard pile, or everyone's had a go as storyteller. For first time players, I suggest using a coin and some paper to make a conflict tracker. Draw a line, put some points on that line, and move the coin along the line until you reach the end! #footnote[If you're the kind of person who values "planning", you could write locations or themes on each of those points. But that's veering in to GM territory!]

= Order of Play
+ Players roll 2 dice. The highest rolling becomes the storyteller.
+ Supply the storyteller with the prompt cards and let them have a think!
+ The storyteller guides the players towards an conflict encounter, using their imagination. Though if this fails you, you can skip as much of this as you like. This is what the prompt cards are for. The storyteller is able to hand out free dice and discards, and allow the players to make rolls for engagement. Have fun with it!
+ Have a conflict! The storyteller shouldn't feel limited to just fighting things. #footnote[In the world, your conflict session could be racing, arguing with someone, or fighting the very earth below you to dig a hole. Go wild!]
+ If you haven't met your last stand condition, return to step 1.
+ If you have met your last stand condition #footnote[Or you just want to get the game over with!], do a last stand!

= Storyteller, Improv Phase
Honestly I need to beta test this before I give advice on this.

= Conflict Phase
#figure(

  ],
)
Modified perudo is played, alternating between each player (fig 1, blue guys) in a circle and the storyteller (fig 1, green). The storyteller always goes first, and the player next to the storyteller in the direction of play goes next.
For instance: 
+ Storyteller
+ Player 1
+ Storyteller (again!)
+ Player 2
+ Storyteller
+ Player 3

Besides the ability cards and the play order, the other modification from Perudo is the "Palefico" rule is removed.

== Order of Play on Conflict Turn
- Use OR draw an abilty card OR discard 3 cards to take a card from the discard pile.
- Then play normal Perudo (raise, dudo, calza etc.)
And that's it! Note that some ability cards can be played at any time, this is not counted as using your "use or draw an abiity card" step.


= Storyteller, Conflict Phase
The storyteller is free to craft their own encounter. It's their job to try and make something fun, though try not to change the rules on the fly too much! I suggest ceremonially placing the Storyteller's normal cards in an envelope so they don't get mixed up.

Storytellers may:
- Role play as their own character, but posessed! (Definitely give them more dice than their starting dice, I reckon around 1 per player plus 1)
- Use one of the premade enemy packs
- Use an unused player character
- Go nuts and make their own character using cards from all over the deck.
- Use pre-prepared homebrew I guess I'm not your mum.

Before the conflict, they should establish:
- Their character's number of dice
- Thier character's kill loot
- Their character's chip damage loot (if any)
- Their character's damage penalty (when the storyteller damages the player) (if any)
For kill loot, I suggest cards associated with that monster, or extra dice or whatever. Negotiate with the players for what seems fair before the encounter begins, or give them a surprise! Not every conflict needs to be a boss fight with big loot!

During a conflict, storytellers almost like normal players, except can't draw ability cards, only play them! They should just do more evil laughing.

After their possession the storyteller can choose to EITHER: 
- Match dice with the player with the most dice
- Match number of ability cards with the player with the most ability cards
- Gain a dice
- Gain an ability card associated with the character they just played as (though players get first dibs if offered as loot)

= Tips and Notes on Conflict
== Secrecy
In order to effectively beat the storyteller, players need to discretely communicate what dice they actually have. If the storyteller works out what you're talking, then they can't exactly not act on it.
== Bribery
Useless cards can be used as bribe tokens. Bribes can be announced at any time by any player. You can only bribe people to do things to do something they can perform immediately, ie. Chieftain playing the Justice card that can still only be played as their draw/play action on thei turn, so the bribe can only happen then. Once there's verbal agreement, and payment (in useless facts) changes hands, the agreed action must happen immediately. Storyteller is judge.

= Voting
If odd number of total players, Storyteller abstains then tie breaks. If even number of total players, Storyteller votes. If ANY abstentions, Storyteller decides outcome.

= Last Stand
Just go around in a circle, and play Nomral Perudo against each other. No bosses, not possessions, just going Player 1, Player 2, PLayer 3 in a cirle, and Palefico is back (if you want it to be back). Last one standing gets to win the coolest resurrection (or, if they never died, to just leave the otherworld.)]
