Perudo, as far as I can tell without further researching and getting Sad, was likely learnt from indigenous peoples by europeans during The Bad Times. This game is dedicated to the countless who died and suffered, and still to this day, in the colonised world. And, yes, that includes Ireland.

Inspiration for the name and loose setting for this game is drawn from Irish and Celtic folklore. The game doesn't really go deep into it, but you should perhaps!

Thanks to everyone who beta tested and provided fun facts! May your names live on for 1000 years in this glorious manual.
